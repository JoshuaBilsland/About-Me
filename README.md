# Introduction & Purpose
The purpose of this file is to aid as a sort of guide to my GitHub profile and my journey learning about computer science and programming. As stated above (and in more detail in the section below), I hope to get a software development apprenticeship and plan to use my profile as my main way to show what I know, what I can do, what I have learnt, etc. This file will have sections talking about this as well as containing a chronological overview of all my projects, categorised into the sections: GCSEs (repos created during my GCSEs), A-Levels (repos created during my A-Levels), Post A-Levels (repos created after I finished A-Levels and now that I am out of school). Hopefully, this will create a structure that will allow potential employers to look through and see how I have improved over time and what I have been doing since I have finished school.
