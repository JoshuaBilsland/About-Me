# Introduction & Purpose
The purpose of this file is to aid as a sort of guide to my GitHub profile and my journey learning about computer science and programming. As stated above (and in more detail in the section below), I hope to get a software development apprenticeship and plan to use my profile as my main way to show what I know, what I can do, what I have learnt, etc. This file will have sections talking about this as well as containing a chronological overview of all my projects, categorised into the sections: GCSEs (repos created during my GCSEs), A-Levels (repos created during my A-Levels), Post A-Levels (repos created after I finished A-Levels and now that I am out of school). Hopefully, this will create a structure that will allow potential employers to look through and see how I have improved over time and what I have been doing since I have finished school.

# Path, Goals & Career Aims
I will try to keep this section short, as I will go into more detail in the introductory sections to the different categories my repos will be sorted into. With that said, for many years I was interested in engineering, mechanics, and cars. I had originally wanted to be a car mechanic, but I did not really enjoy engineering at GCSEs and found myself enjoying computer science and programming much more (and feeling I was better at it). I was initially interested in cyber security and pen testing. I spent a few years, from GCSEs to A-Levels, learning about these topics (completing things like the 'Portswigger Web Security Academy'). I did enjoy learning about this; however, particularly at A-Level, I did not have the time to fully commit to it due to the amount of school work I had. At the same time as this, in my lessons I was learning much more advanced programming concepts than what I had learned at GCSE, such as OOP, DSA, recursion, Big O, etc. After this, I found myself enjoying programming more than the cyber security stuff I was doing in my spare time. My A-Level coursework for computer science allowed me to create a project of my choosing. I decided to create a GUI draughts game with an AI to play against (https://github.com/JoshuaBilsland/Draughts-with-AI). Completing a large project like this made up my mind, and I decided that I wanted to focus on programming and become a software developer. I have now finished A-Levels, and I am currently working full-time as a production operative. I wanted to do at least a year of work to get some savings, learn to drive, learn more about programming/CS, etc. My next step after this is to hopefully get a software development apprenticeship. When I am not working, I am learning more and completing projects to try and help improve my chances of getting an apprenticeship when the time comes that I start applying for one.
